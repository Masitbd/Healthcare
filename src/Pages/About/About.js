      <p className="">
        The prospect of spending hours in a queue at the diagnostic lab or the
        hospital deters many or at least prompts them to defer stepping out for
        diagnostic tests. For many people, the idea of spending hours in a lab
        or hospital may sound demotivating. Many people also avoid going for
        preventive screenings and lab tests as they dread battling city traffic.
        In certain cases, travel-related stress can increase the risk of
        infection and delay recovery. At COVID times, many also don't want to
        visit labs to avoid spread or contamination.

        Elderly patients who face problems in travelling and prefer the tests to
        be conducted in the comfort of their home or patients with morbidity who
        cannot move or go to the lab to perform a test or when it is not
        feasible for them to travel to the lab, prefer to get the blood sample
        collection at home. Doorstep sample collection facility reduces the
        anxiety and it is less stressful for the patient as visiting the lab.
        Moreover there are people who are immunocompromised, people suffering
        from diseases like cancer which cause less immunity in their body; these
        people are very vulnerable and any disease can get easily transmitted to
        their body. Due to such conditions, it is always good for them to have
        the facility of blood collection from home, especially when people do
        seek for such facility from a trusted centre, a lab which they can rely
        on.

        Amidst the labs providing doorstep sample collection services, one
        should trust an institution, which consistently serves customers with
        quality care at any given point of time. Hygiene should be maintained
        during blood collection, even the needle for pricking should be in a
        sterile condition. Sometimes the patient can face vasovagal shock at the
        time of blood extraction if it is not performed by a skilled or
        experienced phlebotomist. Anatomical disposal can be another problem as
        it has a method. Above all, there can be a behavioral issue which is not
        at all a point to let go. United Hospital's skilled and expert home
        sample collection team keeps in mind all these aspects, maintains all
        the necessary hygiene protocol and treat the patients empathetically to
        give out the best to deliver a pleasant & comfortable experience to the
        patients. Along with advanced machines at its lab with guaranteed test
        accuracy and on-time delivery of the reports, the goal is always to put
        the best foot forward.
